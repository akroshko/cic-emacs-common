cic-emacs-common: A collection of useful Emacs Lisp code
========================================================

This package provides some general-purpose Emacs Lisp code. The MELPA
packages required are in `cic-emacs-site.el`.  Right now there is not
an easy way to avoid key remappings and other configurations I use.
However, this code is provided because it may be useful to others who
wish to use Emacs in similar ways to what I do.
